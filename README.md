### Introduction
Pulsar is a highly magnetized neutron star or a dwarf star, that emits electromagnetic radiation out of its magnetic poles. Such stars are very dense and have high rotation, thus giving pulsing phenomenon. Pulsars are a source of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. Pulsars in a binary system are used to confirm the existence of gravitational waves. They are also much more accurate than atomic time measuring clocks here on earth. Confirming the existence of pulsar stars require manual checking of data from the telescope. With this project, we aim to automate the findings of pulsars by using predictive analytics.
